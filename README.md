# AAIC-GK2-Script-Converter

A python script which can convert Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit scripts files from Ace Attorney Investigations Collection to txt files and vice-versa. It WON'T work with NDS or Android files.

For converting Ace Attorney Investigations - Miles Edgeworth script files, see https://github.com/Aclios/AAIC-GK1-Script-Converter

# Usage

Modify the bat files by replacing <script_dir> by the path of the folder containing your script files, and <txt_dir> by the path of the folder where you want your txt files to be written.

Then, you can run export.bat to convert the scripts to txts, modify the txts, and run import.bat whenever you want to convert them back to the game format.
